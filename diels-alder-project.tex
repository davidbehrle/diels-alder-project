\section*{A Green Multi-step Synthesis of \textit{N}-phenylmaleimides and Their Application In Furan/Maleimide Diels-Alder Reactions}
David Behrle

\subsection*{INTRODUCTION}
The Diels-Alder reaction is a prominent pericyclic reaction in organic chemistry that is able to reliably form cyclohexene rings with predictable regio- and stereochemistry under relatively simple conditions.\cite{Brocksom2001} The reaction occurs between a conjugated diene, and dienophile and proceeds via a concerted [4+2] cycloaddition, the simplicity of which allows for a considerable amount of synthetically useful reactions.\cite{Nicolaou2002} In addition to the classic Diels-Alder reaction, there are a number of related variants including the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction, capable of forming bridged and fused polycyclic adducts, the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction which can form a variety of heterocycles, and the hexadehydro Diels-Alder reaction, an analogous alkyne reaction which able to form substituted benzene compounds.\cite{Heravi2015,Hoye2012} There is even evidence of enzymes capable of mediating Diels-Alder reactions in biosynthetic pathways.\cite{Stocking2003} As such it has applications in a wide range of disciplines including the industrial production of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, the total synthesis of natural products, and polymer chemistry among others.\cite{Funel2013,Nicolaou2002,Briou2021}  Of the many diene/dienophile pairs that have been investigated, the reaction between furan and maleimide has been the most studied due to its application in polymer chemistry.\cite{Briou2021} This popularity is in large part due to the convenient temperature range of Diels-Alder/retro-Diels-Alder equilibrium of the reaction, and low possibility of side reactions or thermal degradation.\cite{Gandini2013} These properties have been exploited to produce cross-linked polymeric material capable of re-mending under mild conditions.\cite{Chen2002} A sizeable amount of research has also been put into the application of furan/maleimide polymers with epoxy functionalities in order to develop thermally removable epoxy adhesives.\cite{Mcelhanon2002} Another opposite approach involves the transformation of the Diels-Alder adduct by an aromatization reaction to produce highly thermostable polymers.\cite{Gandini2013} This process is irreversible and produces polymers that are stable at temperatures well above those which favor retro-Diels-Alder reactions in the original adducts.\cite{Tesoro1986} The furan/maleimide combination is also advantageous in terms of green chemistry as there is some interests in the use of furan compounds derived from renewable sources.\cite{Gandini2008} The maleimide component can be obtained in a relatively simple two-step synthesis involving the reaction of maleic anhydride and amines followed by dehydration.\cite{Briou2021} In this paper, we present a green synthesis of \textit{N}-phenylmaleimide precursors by utilizing a solvent free room temperature reaction in the formation of the maleimide, and demonstrate its use as a dienophile in furan/maleimide Diels-Alder reactions. This contributes to the already sizeable body of knowledge on furan/maleimide Diels-Alder reactions, and presents a greener alternative to more traditional synthetic methods.

\bf{Procedure.} Maleic anhydride (0.98 g, 10 mmol) was melted in a mortar on a hot plate. Once melted the mortar was removed from heat and 4-chloroaniline (1.28 g, 10 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was then ground for 10 minutes transferred to a small beaker with 10 mL EtOAc and stirred for one minute. The product was then filtered by vacuum, washed on the filter with EtOAc, and air dried.

\subsection*{DISCUSSION}
\bf{\textit{N}-(4-chloro)maleanilic acid.} The final yield was 1.100 g corresponding to a percent yield of 48.8\%. The experimental NMR spectrum showed two doublet peaks with an integration of 1 corresponding to the hydrogens of maleic anhydride and two doublet peaks with an integration of 2 corresponding to the two sets of identical aromatic hydrogens indicating \textit{para} substitution. Another singlet peak was observed at 10.462 ppm likely corresponding to the amide functional group. No singlet peak was observed for the carboxylic acid O-H proton, potentially due to water remaining in the sample.

\bf{\textit{N}-(4-methyl)maleanilic acid.} The final yield was 1.09 g corresponding to a percent yield of 88.5\%. As with the chloro- analog, the experimental NMR spectrum showed two doublet peaks with an integration of 1 corresponding to the hydrogens of maleic anhydride and two doublet peaks with an integration of 2 corresponding to the two pairs of hydrogens on the aryl ring indicating \textit{para} substitution. A singlet peak at 2.270 ppm due to the \textit{para}-methyl group was also observed. A similar albeit weaker singlet peak was observed at 10.402 ppm with an integration of 1, likely from the amide group. As with the chloro- analog, no singlet peak corresponding to the carboxylic acid O-H proton was detected. 

\bf{\textit{N}-(4-chlorophenyl)maleimide.} The final yield was 0.578 g, corresponding to a percent yield of 57.1\%. The experimental NMR spectrum showed two doublet of triplet peaks with integration of 2 corresponding to the two sets of aromatic hydrogens, and a singlet peak with an integration of 1, corresponding to the two hydrogens of the maleimide functional group. 

\bf{\textit{N}-(4-methylphenyl)maleimide.} The final yield was 0.360 g corresponding to a percent yield of 36.2\%. The experimental NMR spectrum was practically identical to that of the chloro- analog with the exception of a singlet at 2.385 ppm with an integration of 3 corresponding to the \textit{para}-methyl group.

\bf{2-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,7-dimethyl-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-1\textit{H}-4,7-epoxyisoindole-1,3(2\textit{H})-dione.} The final yield was 0.230 g corresponding to a percent yield of 172.1\% due to incomplete drying. The experimental NMR spectrum showed a singlet peak with an integration of 6 corresponding to the methyl groups from 2,5-dimethylfuran, as well as two doublet peaks with an integration of 1 corresponding to the two pairs of aromatic hydrogens. The experimental IR spectrum showed a strong C=O stretching peak at 1702 cm$^{-1}$ which was considerably stronger than the equivalent peak in the IR spectrum of \textit{N}-(4-chlorophenyl)maleimide. 

\bf{4,7-dimethyl-2-(\textit{p}-tolyl)-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-1\textit{H}-4,7-epoxyisoindole-1,3(2\textit{H})-dione.} The final yield was 0.170 g corresponding to a percent yield of 136.5\% due to residual EtOH from incomplete drying. The experimental NMR spectrum was analogous to that of the chloro- analog with a singlet peak at 1.768 with an integration of 6 from the methyl groups of 2,5-dimethyl furan and a singlet at 6.842 with an integration of 3 from the methyl group on the aryl ring. Like in the chloro- analog, the experimental IR spectrum contained a strong C=O stretching peak at 1701 cm$^{-1}$ which was stronger than the equivalent peak at 1705 cm$^{-1}$ in \textit{N}-(4-methylphenyl)maleimide.

\subsection*{CONCLUSION}
In this paper, we have presented two methods for the green synthesis of maleanilic acid derivatives for use in the preparation of \textit{N}-phenylmaleimide derivatieves. These compounds were produced in a green, cost-effective manner and their use in a Diels-Alder reaction with 2,5-dimethylfuran may be generalized to other relevant dienes. These results contribute to the existing body of knowledge and provide a green approach to the synthesis of furan/maleimide Diels-Alder adducts for future application in the fields of polymer chemistry and materials science.
